              Who We Are - The Relique Story

              Relique was founded by a group of U.S.-based financial professionals with extensive experience in
              managing investment funds and high-value assets, in a quest for a new investment vehicle. Drawing on years
              of exposure to global capital markets, we recognized that memorabilia possesses all the characteristics of
              a legitimate financial asset—scarcity, provenance, and enduring value—yet has been held back by
              inconsistent verification and fragmented infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Determined to transform this space, the team set out to address the barriers that have historically
              limited memorabilia&apos;s capacity as an investment asset. By combining rigorous financial discipline with
              strategic insight, we aim to design a platform capable of delivering objectivity, transparency, and
              scalability, elevating memorabilia from mere collectibles to credible assets that investors and collectors
              can trust.
            </p>
            <div className="bg-primaryBlue/5 border-l-4 border-primaryBlue p-8 italic">
              &quot;To realize this vision, Relique chose St.B as its strategic partner and sponsor their AI
              engineering endeavor.&quot;
            </div>
            <p>
              Their deep expertise in artificial intelligence, established sporting ecosystem, and intimate understanding
              of the collectibles market provide critical capabilities. This partnership enables Relique to bridge the
              market knowledge gap and eradicate liability of foreignness, ensuring that every authentication and
              transaction meets the highest standard of credibility and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relique is redefining what it means for memorabilia to be both collectible and investable, creating a
              trusted foundation for a market ready to mature and thrive.

              The founders of Relique all have extensive experience working at financial funds in the United States,
              where investment decisions always revolve around three core factors:{" "}
              <span className="text-white font-bold">value – risk – trust</span>. Throughout that process, we witnessed:

              {[
                "Traditional financial assets increasingly rely on intermediary trust.",
                "Fraud, manipulation, and geopolitical instability have shaken confidence in many assets.",
                "Global capital has begun seeking alternative asset classes that are clearly scarce.",
              ].map((point, i) => (
                <li
                  key={i}
                  className="flex gap-4 items-start bg-cardDark border border-white/5 p-6 group hover:border-primaryBlue transition-colors"

                </li>
              ))}
            </ul>
            <p>
              From the perspective of asset managers with extensive background in institutional finance, we realized that memorabilia—items tied to people, events, and history that cannot be replicated—possess many of the characteristics of long-term valuable assets: objective scarcity, sustainable collector demand, and cultural value across time.
              <br /><br />
              Unlike most traditional financial assets, collectibles have an abstract value driven by a passionate base — much like fine art. According to Kiplinger, of the most reputable financial publication, the demand for sports collectibles has recorded unprecedented growth since the pandemic, outperforming even the S&P 500. Their valuation in the market is expected to have a CAGR of 21.8% over the next decade.
              The fact that Sotheby’s—whose past auctions include a $157.2 million Modigliani and a $139.4 million Picasso—has stepped into the sports memorabilia market speaks volume. We might as well be witnessing the emergence of a new blue chip investment class.
