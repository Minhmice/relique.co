  "prompt": "Create a square (1:1) premium studio product photo using the referenced images as the ONLY ground-truth for the product. The product is an FC Barcelona jersey with authentic details: exact fabric pattern, exact colors, exact Nike swoosh, exact Spotify sponsor, exact FCB crest, and on the BACK the exact name-number \"RAPHINHA 22\" with a real autograph on the number. The autograph must be present and clearly visible as a signature (does not need perfect readability), and MUST match the reference in placement and shape.\n\nBACKGROUND: solid studio dark neutral gray #1B1F26 with a very subtle smooth gradient and soft vignette (no texture, no pattern, no props, no environment).\n\nCOMPOSITION (WIDE / HERO): show the BACK side as the primary view. Jersey is floating/levitating (no hanger visible, no mannequin visible), with natural fabric drape and slight 3/4 yaw (about 10–15 degrees) to add depth while keeping name-number readable. Centered framing, full jersey in frame with comfortable margins. Add a faint soft shadow under the jersey (very subtle) to reinforce levitation realism.\n\nLIGHTING (TEXTURE EMPHASIS): cinematic low-key studio lighting—soft key light from upper front-left, gentle rim light from rear-right to separate edges from the dark background. Use raking light angle (30–45 degrees) to bring out textile weave, stitching lines, and print edges while avoiding glare on printed areas. Keep whites clean (no blown highlights) and preserve true-to-reference colors.\n\nCAMERA LOOK: high-end commercial product photography, 50mm lens look, f/2.8, shallow depth of field but maintain full jersey sharpness (front-to-back acceptable), crisp micro-contrast on fabric texture, realistic noise-free finish.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- DO NOT change, redraw, replace, or stylize any logos, sponsor marks, typography, colors, crest details, Nike swoosh, Spotify mark, name, number, or autograph.\n- DO NOT add any new text, badges, watermarks, QR codes, labels, or extra signatures.\n- DO NOT invent missing details; if uncertain, preserve exactly what is visible in the references.\n- No props, no hands, no background objects, no stadium, no people.\n\nOUTPUT: photorealistic, premium, marketplace-ready hero image."
