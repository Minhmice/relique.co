  "prompt": "Create a square (1:1) premium studio product hero image. Use the referenced images as the ONLY ground-truth for the exact jersey identity and details.\n\nSUBJECT: The exact FC Barcelona home jersey from the references. Show the FRONT side clearly. All marks must remain exactly as in the references: Nike swoosh, Spotify sponsor, FC Barcelona crest, fabric pattern, colors, collar/sleeve details.\n\nBACKGROUND (CONSISTENT SERIES): Solid dark neutral studio backdrop exactly #1B1F26, with a very subtle smooth gradient and soft vignette. No texture, no pattern, no props, no environment.\n\nCOMPOSITION (WIDE / HERO): Full jersey in frame, centered with clean margins. Jersey is floating/levitating (no hanger, no mannequin, no visible supports). Natural drape and slight 3/4 yaw (10–15 degrees) for depth while keeping chest logos readable. Add a faint soft shadow below the jersey (very subtle) to sell the levitation.\n\nLIGHTING (TEXTURE + LOGO CLARITY): Cinematic low-key studio lighting.\n- Soft key light from upper-left, diffused.\n- Gentle rim light from rear-right to separate edges from #1B1F26 background.\n- Raking component to emphasize fabric weave and stitching, but avoid glare on printed sponsor.\nKeep whites clean; preserve true-to-reference color.\n\nCAMERA LOOK: High-end commercial product photography. 50mm lens aesthetic, f/2.8. Keep the entire jersey sharp enough for marketplace use while still feeling cinematic.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- DO NOT change, redraw, replace, stylize, or rearrange any logos, sponsor marks, typography, colors, crest details.\n- DO NOT add any new text, watermark, labels, badges, QR codes, or extra marks.\n- Do not invent missing details; if uncertain, preserve what’s visible in the references.\n\nOUTPUT: Photorealistic, premium, marketplace-ready front hero image with strong fabric texture and crisp logos."
