  "prompt": "Create a square (1:1) premium studio product photo. Use the referenced images as the ONLY source of truth for the jersey’s exact identity. The product is the FC Barcelona jersey with the same fabric pattern, colors, sponsor/club marks, and the BACK name-number \"RAPHINHA 22\". The autograph on the number must be clearly present and recognizable as a real signature, matching the reference placement and stroke shape (it does NOT need perfect legibility).\n\nBACKGROUND / CONSISTENCY: Use a uniform studio backdrop exactly #1B1F26 with a subtle smooth gradient and gentle vignette. Absolutely no patterns, no textures, no props, no environment.\n\nSHOT TYPE (MEDIUM / BACK FOCUS): Medium framing of the BACK side. Crop from upper shoulders to below the number area (keep some lower jersey visible). The name arc \"RAPHINHA\" and the full number \"22\" must be in frame. The signature must sit inside the sharpest focus region.\n\nPOSE / PRESENTATION: Jersey floating (levitating) with natural drape. Very slight 3/4 angle (5–10 degrees) to show depth, but keep the name-number plane readable. No hanger, no mannequin, no visible supports.\n\nLIGHTING (INK + TEXTILE): Low-key studio lighting tuned for texture: \n- Soft key light from upper-left (diffused) to reveal weave and stitching.\n- Raking accent light across the number area to bring out print edge relief and subtle ink sheen.\n- A gentle rim light from the opposite side to separate the jersey edge from the dark background.\nAvoid glare on printed elements; preserve true-to-reference colors; keep whites from clipping.\n\nCAMERA / DETAIL: High-end commercial look, 85mm lens aesthetic, f/2.2–f/2.8. Depth of field should keep the entire name-number area (including the signature) crisp. Micro-contrast should emphasize fabric knit, perforations, and seams without making it look over-sharpened or artificial.\n\nRETOUCH GUIDELINES: Light cleanup only—reduce distracting wrinkles while keeping realistic fabric behavior. Do not ‘beautify’ by changing any marks. No color shifts.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- DO NOT change, redraw, replace, or stylize any logos, sponsor marks, typography, colors, crest details, Nike swoosh, Spotify mark, name, number, or autograph.\n- DO NOT add any new text, watermarks, labels, badges, QR codes, or extra signatures.\n- DO NOT invent details not present in the references.\n\nOUTPUT: Photorealistic, marketplace-ready, premium studio product image with the autograph visibly present."
