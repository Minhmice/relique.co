  "prompt": "Generate a square (1:1) ultra-realistic macro product photo. Use the referenced images as the ONLY ground-truth for the exact jersey identity and all marks.\n\nSUBJECT (FRONT MACRO): The exact FC Barcelona jersey from the references. Create a tight close-up focusing on the FC Barcelona crest patch/embroidery and the surrounding fabric weave. Include visible stitching relief, thread texture, edge bonding, and subtle fabric micro-patterns. If composition allows, include a small portion of either the Nike swoosh or the Spotify sponsor edge ONLY if it remains true-to-reference and not distorted.\n\nBACKGROUND / SERIES CONSISTENCY:\n- Backdrop color must be exactly #1B1F26.\n- Smooth gradient + gentle vignette only.\n- No background texture, no environment, no props.\n\nCOMPOSITION (CLOSE-UP / MACRO):\n- Crop tightly so the crest occupies ~35–55% of the frame.\n- Keep the crest fully in frame (no cut-off) unless the reference close-up is already partially cropped—if so, match the reference crop style.\n- Ensure the primary focal plane is on crest stitching and fabric weave right next to it.\n\nLIGHTING (STITCHING + TEXTILE):\n- Macro-friendly studio lighting: soft diffused key from upper-left to reveal thread relief.\n- A subtle specular accent to show stitching height and patch edge definition.\n- Avoid glare / hot spots; keep colors accurate.\n\nCAMERA LOOK:\n- 100mm macro aesthetic.\n- f/4 look: crest and adjacent fabric tack sharp, background falloff smooth.\n- High micro-contrast for texture, but do NOT oversharpen.\n\nRETOUCH GUIDELINES:\n- Minimal cleanup only (remove dust/noise), keep realistic fibers.\n- No color shifts, no smoothing that removes knit texture.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- DO NOT change, redraw, replace, stylize, or reposition any logos, crest details, sponsor marks, typography, colors, or fabric pattern.\n- DO NOT add any new text, watermark, labels, badges, QR codes, or extra marks.\n- Do not invent missing details; preserve exactly what’s visible in the references.\n\nOUTPUT: Photorealistic, premium marketplace-ready macro detail emphasizing crest stitching and textile texture on the consistent #1B1F26 backdrop."
