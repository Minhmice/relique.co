  "prompt": "Generate a square (1:1) ultra-realistic macro product photo. Treat the referenced images as the ONLY ground-truth for the exact jersey and the exact autograph. This is the FC Barcelona jersey; we are shooting the BACK side detail where the autograph sits on the printed number.\n\nBACKGROUND / CONSISTENCY:\n- Solid studio backdrop color exactly #1B1F26.\n- Very subtle smooth gradient + gentle vignette only.\n- No visible texture, no pattern, no props, no environment.\n\nSHOT TYPE (CLOSE-UP / MACRO DETAIL):\n- Tight macro crop on the autograph ink over the number and surrounding fabric.\n- The autograph must be clearly present as a real signature, with the same stroke shape, thickness, edges, and placement as the reference.\n- Include enough nearby material to show: knit weave / perforations, stitching lines, print edges of the number.\n- Keep framing clean; no partial extra text invented.\n\nLIGHTING (INK + FABRIC RELIEF):\n- Controlled macro lighting to bring out texture: a soft key light from upper-left (diffused), plus a very subtle specular accent that reveals slight ink sheen and the print surface relief.\n- Avoid glare and blown highlights (especially on white number print).\n- Preserve true-to-reference colors and ink tone.\n\nCAMERA / RENDER LOOK:\n- 100mm macro lens aesthetic.\n- f/4 look (macro DOF: signature region tack sharp, background falls off smoothly).\n- High micro-contrast for textile grain and ink edges, but not oversharpened.\n- Noise-free, premium commercial finish.\n\nRETOUCH RULES:\n- Minimal cleanup only (remove sensor noise/dust if any), but keep material realism.\n- Do NOT smooth out the ink or fabric to the point it looks fake.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- DO NOT redraw, replace, stylize, or alter the autograph in any way; keep it exactly as in the reference.\n- DO NOT change any printed graphics, typography, colors, or add/remove any marks.\n- DO NOT add any new text, watermarks, extra signatures, labels, or badges.\n\nOUTPUT:\n- Photorealistic marketplace-ready macro detail that clearly shows the presence of the authentic signature and the jersey’s texture."
