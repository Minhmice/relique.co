  "prompt": "Generate a square (1:1) premium studio product photo. Use the referenced images as the ONLY ground-truth for the exact jersey identity and all details.\n\nSUBJECT (FRONT SIDE): The exact FC Barcelona jersey from the references. Show the FRONT chest area clearly: FCB crest, Nike swoosh, and Spotify sponsor must be present and unchanged.\n\nBACKGROUND (SERIES CONSISTENCY): Solid studio backdrop color exactly #1B1F26 with a subtle smooth gradient and soft vignette. No texture, no pattern, no props, no environment.\n\nSHOT TYPE (MEDIUM / CHEST FOCUS): Medium crop framing the front from upper shoulders down to mid-torso. Keep the full sponsor mark and both crest + swoosh entirely within frame (no cut-off). Ensure straight-on-ish perspective with a very slight 3/4 angle (5–8 degrees max) to avoid distortion while still showing garment depth.\n\nPRESENTATION: Jersey is floating/levitating with natural drape (no hanger, no mannequin, no visible supports). Add an extremely subtle soft shadow beneath the garment area (barely visible) to maintain realism.\n\nLIGHTING (TEXTURE + PRINT CONTROL): Premium low-key studio lighting tuned for textile texture and print clarity:\n- Soft diffused key light from upper-left to reveal knit weave and stitching.\n- Gentle fill from front-right to keep sponsor readable.\n- Subtle rim light to separate edges from the #1B1F26 background.\nAvoid glare/specular blowouts on sponsor print. Preserve true-to-reference color.\n\nCAMERA LOOK: High-end commercial product photography, 70–85mm aesthetic, f/2.4–f/2.8. The entire logo cluster area must be tack-sharp; background falloff smooth.\n\nRETOUCH GUIDELINES: Minimal cleanup only—reduce distracting wrinkles but keep realistic fabric behavior. No color shifts. No reshaping of logos.\n\nHARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST FOLLOW):\n- DO NOT change, redraw, replace, stylize, or reposition any logos, sponsor marks, typography, colors, crest details, or fabric pattern.\n- DO NOT add any new text, watermark, labels, badges, QR codes, or extra marks.\n- Do not invent missing details; preserve exactly what exists in the references.\n\nOUTPUT: Photorealistic, marketplace-ready medium front shot with strong textile texture and crisp sponsor/crest/swoosh."
